# Commands Reference

Full documentation for `show` and `look` commands.

## Design Philosophy

Show-and-tell provides an **abstraction layer** for AI assistants to share visual context with users without requiring knowledge of the underlying display system.

**The key insight:** An agent should be able to say "show the user this file" or "see what the user is looking at" without needing to know whether the user is in tmux, VS Code, a plain terminal, or a web interface.

Currently, the implementation uses tmux + Neovim, but this could be adapted to:
- VS Code with appropriate extensions
- Web-based IDEs
- Plain terminal with less/cat fallbacks
- Remote display via screen sharing

This separation means:
- **tmux skill** - teaches an agent how to use tmux directly
- **neovim skill** - teaches an agent how to use Neovim directly
- **show-and-tell** - provides high-level "show" and "look" abstractions that work regardless of backend

## show - Display Content

Opens content for the user to view in the appropriate application.

```
Usage: show <target> [OPTIONS]

Targets:
  <file>                   Open file in Neovim
  <file>:<line>            Open file at specific line
  <file>#L<line>           Open file at specific line (URL fragment style)
  http://... https://...   Open URL in browser
  cmd:<command>            Run command in shell pane
  pane:<id>                Focus tmux pane by ID

Options:
  -s, --session NAME       Tmux session for show window (default: show)
  -p, --pane ID            Target specific pane ID
```

### Open files in Neovim

```bash
show README.md                    # Open file in Neovim
show src/main.py:42               # Open at line 42
show src/main.py#L42              # Same (URL fragment style)
show ~/Code/project/config.yaml   # Absolute path
```

The show command:
- Uses nvim-remote to open files in existing Neovim instances
- Falls back to starting Neovim in the "show" tmux session
- Waits up to 3 seconds for Neovim socket to become available
- Supports line numbers in both `:N` and `#LN` formats

### Open URLs in browser

```bash
show https://github.com/owner/repo
show https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html
show github.com                   # Auto-adds https://
```

Opens in Firefox by default (falls back to system default browser).

### Run commands in shell pane

```bash
show "cmd:git status"             # Show git status
show "cmd:git diff HEAD~1"        # Show recent changes
show "cmd:ls -la"                 # List files
show "cmd:docker ps"              # Show running containers
show "cmd:pytest -v"              # Run tests with output
```

Commands run in the shell pane of the "show" tmux session, allowing the user to see live output.

### Focus specific pane

```bash
show pane:15                      # Focus pane %15
show pane:%23                     # With explicit % prefix
```

### Advanced options

```bash
show file.py -s dev               # Use "dev" session instead of "show"
show file.py -p %36               # Open in specific pane
```

## look - Observe Context

Captures what the user is currently viewing with tmux hierarchy and pane content.

```
Usage: look [OPTIONS] [TARGET]

Targets:
  (none)                   Current pane content
  %<id>                    Specific pane by ID
  %1,%2,%3                 Multiple panes (comma-separated)
  window                   All panes in current window
  <session>:<window>       All panes in specific window

Options:
  -l, --lines N            Lines of scrollback history (default: visible)
  -H, --hierarchy          Show tmux hierarchy only (no content)
  -p, --preserve-blanks    Preserve exact blank line spacing
```

### Basic observation

```bash
look                              # Current pane - visible screen
look -l 100                       # Last 100 lines of scrollback
look -l 500                       # More history for long output
```

### View tmux hierarchy only

```bash
look -H
```

Output example:
```
Tmux summary:
-> main: *claude[%15 %16], logs[%23] (attached)
  dev: editor[%30], tests[%31 %32]
  (in main:0 pane %15)
```

Legend:
- `->` indicates current session
- `*` indicates active window
- Pane IDs shown in brackets

### Multiple panes

```bash
look %15,%16                      # Two specific panes
look window                       # All panes in current window
look main:0                       # All panes in main session window 0
```

### Preserve formatting

```bash
look -p                           # Keep exact blank line spacing
look -p -l 50                     # With scrollback
```

### Output Format

The `look` command provides structured output:

```
Tmux summary:
-> main: *show[%15], claude[%16 %17] (attached)
  (in main:0 pane %15)

[Neovim detected in pane %15]
File: /Users/admin/project/src/main.py
Position: line 42, column 8
Mode: n
Tip: Use nvim-remote for full editor control

--- Pane %15 content ---
(Showing visible screen. Use -l 200 for more history)
[actual pane content here]
```

## Sensitive Content Detection

The `look` command automatically scans captured content for potentially sensitive information:

### Detected patterns

- Password assignments: `password = "..."`, `PASSWORD: ...`
- API keys: `api_key = "..."`, `API_KEY=...`
- Secrets/tokens: `secret = "..."`, `token = "..."`
- Long uppercase strings (20+ chars): Potential API keys
- Private keys: `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`

### Warning output

When sensitive content is detected, look adds a warning:

```
Warning: Potential sensitive information detected
Consider reviewing before sharing. Use -H to show hierarchy only without content.
```

### Best practices

- Review output before sharing in logs or conversations
- Use `look -H` to get hierarchy without content when sensitive data may be present
- Be aware that terminal history may contain secrets from previous commands

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SHOW_SESSION` | `show` | Default tmux session name for show window |
| `SHOW_BROWSER` | (auto) | Browser for URLs (e.g., `Firefox`, `Chrome`, `Safari`) |
| `NVIM_SOCKET_PATH` | (auto) | Override Neovim socket path |

## Installation and Running Commands

### Finding the Commands

The `show` and `look` commands may be installed in different locations:

**If installed as a Claude Code plugin:**
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/show <target>
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/look [options]
```

**If installed via metool:**
```bash
show <target>
look [options]
# Or explicitly: ~/.metool/bin/show, ~/.metool/bin/look
```

**Note:** The system has a `look` command (dictionary lookup) that may shadow this package's `look`. Use the full path if needed.

### Checking Installation

```bash
which show look                                    # Check if in PATH
ls ~/.metool/bin/show ~/.metool/bin/look          # Check metool
ls ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/show                 # Check plugin
```
